# Flutter Drawer Example
This project demonstrates a simple Flutter application that includes a navigation drawer. The main functionality is split across two files: main.dart and navbar.dart.

## Files
### main.dart
We only have to add the line drawer: NavBar().

### navbar.dart
This file defines the NavBar widget, which is a custom navigation drawer. The drawer contains several navigation options represented as ListTile widgets.
